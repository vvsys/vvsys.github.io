scratch the p5.js ting, i'm gonna make this a crypto diary to track my pnl for, well, crypto

i hate losing so let's see where this goes.

initial investment: $500
aped into $baby about a week ago since it looked promising, but i'm trying to convince myself to hodl some coins and trade up on others so i can get some good gainzzzz

investment reached ~$2500 but i'm back down since the market is garbage
pulled out

ending investment: $760
pnl: +$260

not bad at all really, if my goal is $27/day to cover all bills and whatnot, i've hit $37/day this past week or so

time to research and see what happens next
